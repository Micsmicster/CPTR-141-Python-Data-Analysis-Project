# Romanian Earthquake Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes earthquake patterns in Romania using Python. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains seismic activity records, which were explored to uncover trends, magnitudes, and frequencies of earthquakes. The project involves data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques to gain insights into seismic behavior.

## ðŸ“Š Features & Analysis
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, formatting, and structuring data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Finding min, max, average magnitude, and frequency of earthquakes.
- **User Interaction**: Allowing users to input specific criteria (e.g., date range, magnitude threshold) for custom analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating graphs to illustrate earthquake trends over time.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **NumPy** for numerical analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [Romanian Earthquake Data](https://www.kaggle.com) *(replace with actual link)*.
