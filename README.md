# CPTR 141 Final Project

## Earthquake Data Analysis in Romania

## Introduction
This project analyzes earthquake data recorded in Romania since 2012. The dataset includes details such as date and time, magnitude, magnitude type, depth, latitude, longitude, and zone. The primary objective of this analysis is to study earthquake patterns in Romania, identify high-risk areas, and explore potential preventive measures to enhance safety and structural integrity. Additionally, by examining past earthquake trends, we can attempt to predict future occurrences.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains comprehensive earthquake records from 2012 to 2024.

**Dataset Link:** [Earthquakes in Romania 2012-2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefancomanita/earthquakes-in-romania-from-2012-to-2024?resource=download)

### Dataset Columns:
- **dateTime** â€“ Timestamp of the earthquake
- **magnitude** â€“ Magnitude of the earthquake
- **magnitude type** â€“ Type of magnitude measurement
- **depth** â€“ Depth of the earthquake in kilometers
- **latitude** â€“ Latitude coordinate
- **longitude** â€“ Longitude coordinate
- **zone description** â€“ Description of the affected zone

## Objectives and Features
With this dataset, I aim to extract and analyze key insights, including:
- Identifying the latest and earliest recorded earthquakes
- Finding the top 10 highest and lowest magnitude earthquakes
- Finding the top 10 deepest and shallowest earthquakes
- Calculating the average and median latitude and longitude of all recorded earthquakes
- Identifying the top 10 zones where earthquakes are most frequent
- Analyzing the correlation between earthquake magnitude and depth

### User Interaction
The program includes user input functionalities to allow users to:
- Search for earthquakes within a specified date range
- Filter earthquakes based on magnitude
- Search for earthquakes within a specified depth range

## Skills and Learning Outcomes
By working on this project, I aim to gain hands-on experience in:
- **File handling** â€“ Managing and processing uploaded files in Python
- **Dataset handling** â€“ Extracting and manipulating data to gain meaningful insights
- **Pandas module** â€“ Utilizing built-in functions for data analysis

In a world increasingly driven by data, mastering dataset handling and analysis is a valuable skill. This project serves as a foundational step toward building expertise in data science and analytics, which can be applied in fields like earthquake prediction, climate studies, and engineering.
